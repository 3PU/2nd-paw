## General Information

### Code Institute Coding Bootcamp - Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project

This is my fourth milestone project created during my coding bootcamp at Code Institute.

The idea behind 2nd Paws is to support local cat & dog shelters by providing pet owners with online meeting portal to donate/exchange pet clothes, toys and supplies that they no longer need/use.

All profits generated on the 2nd Paws website go directly to the cat and dog shelters in Stockholm, supporting their fantastic work.

Visitors to the website are also presented with the option to make monetary donations that directly are forwarded to the cat and dog shelters that 2nd Paw's supports.

## Demo

A live demo of the website can be found [here](https://codei-2nd-paws.herokuapp.com/).
