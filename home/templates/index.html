                    <hr>
                    <p>2ND PAWS is a non-profit organization, closely working together with all major cat & dog
                    shelters in the Stockholm area. We are providing pet owners with an online meeting portal to
                    donate/exchange pet clothes, toys and supplies that they no longer need/use. All profits
                    generated on our website go directly to the cat and dog shelters in Stockholm, supporting
                    their fantastic work.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>...experienced this? You buy a new toy, full of excitement to see your pet play with it.
            But once you present it, you're left with an empty look on your pets face only to see your
            furry friend wanders off and start playing with some random thing in your house? Now you're
            sitting there with a toy that you have no use for as your pet was completely uninterested?</p>
            <p>Rest assured, this is a very common experience for many pet owners and we all have faced
            this akward situation many times. At 2nd Paws we offer you the opportunity to donate such
            a product so it can be of use to other pet owners and pets whilst having a positive impact
            by supporting Stockholms cat and dog shelters in their amazing job.</p>
